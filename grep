Shell command used to search within specified files for any lines matching a given regular expression.
Takes two parameters: the first parameter is some text to search for (strictly speaking, this is a regular expression), and the second is what files you want to search through. Wildcards can be useful for formulating these arguments.
If a pipe is used to redirect output to grep (i.e. some file or files to be searched) then only one argment is taken (the expression to be searched for).
