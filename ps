Shell command used to display the status of processes currently run by a controlling terminal.
By default the "ps" command also displays PID, the process ID number; TTYS, referring to the terminal associated with a given process; TIME, a measurement of that process's total CPU usage; and CMD or COMMAND, which is the name of the process and can contain any given arguments.
(ps stands for process status.)
