Shell command used to count the number of words, characters, bytes, and lines in any given file.
If used without switches, writes to standard output in the order: lines, words, bytes, filename. 
Switch "-c" writes out only the number of bytes, switch "-l" returns only the number of lines (counting the number of lines in a file can be useful - for example, processing some redirected output from a grep command which outputs a new line for each file that matches a given expression), switch "-w" writes only the number of words to stdout, switch "-m" writes out only the number of characters (this is often equivalent to "-c", as each character is usually one byte).
